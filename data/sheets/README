input/ is generated from `npm run update-google-sheets`.

output/ is generated from our scripts, and is _not in this repository_:

* `../../update-polls.js` downloads poll data from Pollster
* `../../R/main.R` runs Senate models

The R script takes a long time to run. If you want sample data,
`cp -a sample-output output`
