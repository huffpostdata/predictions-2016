  h2 - By-State Probabilities

  p - The 2016 Senate consists of 54 Republicans and 46 Democrats. (The two independent senators caucus with Democrats.) Voters usually re-elect their incumbent senators, but some seats could flip to the other party.

  p - If four Republican Senate seats flip to Democrats and there are no other changes, the 2017 Senate will be split 50-50.

  var all_races=races.sorted_by('flip-probability')
  var likely_flips=all_races.filter(function(race) { return race.flip_prob >= 0.5 })
  var unlikely_flips=all_races.filter(function(race) { return race.flip_prob < 0.5 })
